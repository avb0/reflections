When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1) When working with other people
2)When I'm using a different computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

1) if anyone else adds to it, it may overwrite your current master branch
2) allows more control on what files go where
3) if the repository is public you may not want to implement the changes other people have made
